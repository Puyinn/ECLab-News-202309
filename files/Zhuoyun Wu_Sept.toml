summary = "该研究通过对波兰和立陶宛Facebook上的4000多个帖子进行情感评估，比较了不同情感理论对社交媒体帖子传播的预测。研究发现，独立建模离散情绪优于建模效价、唤醒度或情绪群集，并且与七种基本情绪模型具有相当的解释力。"
abstract = "While emotional content predicts social media post sharing, competing theories of emotion imply different predictions about how emotional content will influence the virality of social media posts. We tested and compared these theoretical frameworks. Teams of annotators assessed more than 4000 multimedia posts from Polish and Lithuanian Facebook for more than 20 emotions. We found that, drawing on semantic space theory, modeling discrete emotions independently was superior to models examining valence (positive or negative), activation/arousal (high or low), or clusters of emotions and was on par with but had more explanatory power than a seven basic emotion model. Certain discrete emotions were associated with post sharing, including both positive and negative and relatively lower and higher activation/arousal emotions (e.g., amusement, cute/kama muta, anger, and sadness) even when controlling for number of followers, time up, topic, and Facebook angry reactions. These results provide key insights into better understanding of social media post virality."

summary = "研究测试了五个关于共情准确性（即情绪识别能力）和自我观察、内部和人际适应性的理论模型。研究发现，共情准确性与参与者和知情者评定的关系满意度呈正相关，关于共情准确性的自我观察与参与者和知情者评定的生活满意度呈正相关。这些相关性在控制了认知能力的影响后仍然存在。"
abstract = "Are individuals adept at perceiving others’ emotions optimally adjusted? We extend past research by conducting a high-powered preregistered study that comprehensively tests five theoretical models of empathic accuracy (i.e., emotion-recognition ability) and self-views and intra- and interpersonal facets of adjustment in a sample of 1,126 undergraduate students from Canada and 2,205 informants. We obtained both self-reports and peer-reports of adjustment and controlled for cognitive abilities as a potential confounding variable. Empathic accuracy (but not self-views of that ability) was positively related to relationship satisfaction as rated by both participants and informants. Self-views about empathic accuracy (but not actual empathic accuracy) were positively related to life satisfaction as rated by both participants and informants. All associations held when we controlled for cognitive abilities."
